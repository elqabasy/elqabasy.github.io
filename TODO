TODO:
  - Add a page for your relation ships, and projects you have been made together, the page must be futeristic and beautiful and has animations. Also, before start building it, ask ui/ux team to build a ui/ux design for it.
  - Collect all you projects, and host them on github, then add all to this portfolio.
  






prompt:
very very good, there are many new updates i wan to add them, so after i tell you about them, make a prompt for the dev team to start working on those features.



 Dashboard:
  - instead of static data inside ./src/data/; use dynamic data from our account.
  - i suggest start with github data first
  - make the dev team use a centeralized "api" management approach, scalable, reusable and good practices.
  - also i have many usernames on github: elqabasy, mahros-alqabasy, alqabasy. i want the user choose the statistics between those accounts.
  - the team also have to know the api endpoints and their responses
  - endpoints:
   - https://api.github.com/users/elqabasy
   - https://api.github.com/users/elqabasy/received_events
   - https://api.github.com/users/elqabasy/repos
